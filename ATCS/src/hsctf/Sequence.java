//	Keith has a long list of exactly 10^8 integers,
	//but they only want interesting sequences - 
	//where adjacent terms differ by at most one.
	//Keith decides to pick the largest possible interesting subsequence 
	//from their list of 10^8 integers,
	//but alas the subsequence wasn't large enough. 
	//Instead, Keith decided to pick a number to remove from the large list, 
	//and then to find the largest interesting subsequence in the shortened list.
	//Help Keith determine which number they should remove for 
	//the optimal subsequence.
//	For the flag, submit the length of the optimal subsequence, 
	//then a space, then the index of the number removed to achieve that subsequence.
